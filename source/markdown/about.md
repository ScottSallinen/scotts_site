#### Scott Sallinen
I hold a Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia, and I currently work with highly parallel graph processing.  
I enjoy all things technology! I have an unrequited love for Java, even though I work mostly in C, and I can't stop using JSON formatting. (I've tried)  
I'm also interested in Bitcoin from both a user and developer point of view.
