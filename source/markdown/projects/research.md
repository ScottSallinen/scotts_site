## Consistent-Hashing Based Storage
- Developed a scalable system that distributes traffic equally, independent of the amount of nodes in the system.
- Deployed the program successfully across hundreds of participating nodes with the research system PlanetLab.
- Achieved a high throughput of requests (hundreds per second per node) while still handling failure cases (Hotjoin/leave, cold leave, etc.) and redundancy.
