              <h2>Consistent-Hashing based Storage </h2>
              <p>Developed a scalable system that distributes traffic equally, independent of the amount of nodes in the system.
              Deployed the program successfully across hundreds of participating nodes with the research system PlanetLab.
              Achieved a high throughput of requests (hundreds per second per node) while still handling failure cases (Hotjoin/leave, cold leave, etc.) and redundancy.</p>

              <h2>Android Nutrition Application</h2>
              <p>Created a mobile nutrition application with features for recipe viewing and creation, calorie measuring, and graphing.
              Developed using Googleâs Android SDK in collaboration with ReflexWireless.
              Implementing Bluetooth connectivity to ReflexWireless kitchen scales.
              Built rapport with professional clientele under the guidance of course instructors.
              Organized and scheduled a group of 5 team members.</p>

              <h2>Active Gimbal Camera Stabilizer and Robotic Control</h2>
              <p>Led a team of six engineers in construction of a stabilized camera platform, receiving First Place in the IEEE Project Fair 2012.
              Expanded the project to have joystick-controllable pitch roll and yaw, for a fully stabilized spherical camera field of view.
              Developed and implemented a parallel processing control system between two micro-controllers with PC based user control.</p>
